Practice using html by creating a website for at least three recipes.
The site uses basic foundational skills such as creating links, inserting images, and basic html syntax.

The second part of this project is to use CSS to stylize the recipe pages utilizing different selector methods and other lessons taught in the CSS foundations class on TOP.
