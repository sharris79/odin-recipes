    <h4>Yummy Yummy in my Tummy Garlic Bread</h4>
    <p>You may have once struggled with dry or greasy 
        breads reeking of burned or raw garlic, but it's 
        time to put that behind you. This is a versatile 
        recipe, as readily made with thin baguettes, as 
        it is with rustic sourdoughs and airy Italian loaves. 
        Cutting the bread like a Hasselback potato keeps the 
        butter from seeping out and allows the garlic to infuse 
        the bread with its flavor without scorching. But, if 
        it's an extra cheesy garlic bread you're looking for, 
        slip a little mozzarella into each slit.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <uo>
        <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted</li>
        <li>4 fat garlic cloves, grated</li>
        <li>1/2 cup Parmesan, grated</li>
        <li>1/4 cup firmly packed chopped flat-leaf parsley</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp kosher salt</li>
        <li>Black pepper</li>
        <li>1 baguette or rustic crusty loaf</li>
        <li>1/2 pound fresh mozzarella, thinly sliced (optional)</li>
    </uo>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat the oven to 400 degrees.</li>
            <li>In a small bowl, stir together the butter, garlic, parmesan, and parsley.</li>
            <li>Add the salt and generously season with pepper. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Cut deep slits in the baguette, 1 inch apart.</li>
            <li>Place the baguette on a large piece of tinfoil.</li>
            <li>Generously spread the seasoned butter inside each slit</li>
            <li>Wrap the baguette in foil and place on a baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Bake for 15 minutes.</li>
